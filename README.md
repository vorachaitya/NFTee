<!-- # Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js -->
<!-- ``` -->

**_NFT_** means **non-fungible tokens** (NFTs), which are generally created using the same type of programming used for cryptocurrencies. In simple terms these cryptographic assets are based on blockchain technology. They cannot be exchanged or traded equivalently like other cryptographic assets

Here I have created a simple NFT(without any image) using **Hardhat**.Hardhat is an Ethereum development environment and framework designed for full stack development.I have made it using **ERC721** and by importing **Openzeppelin's ERC721 Contract**.

Finally,I have deployed my NFT on **Metamask** using **Goerli** Test Network.

Deployed NFT can be verified by visiting **Goerli Etherscan** and then entering the following address:
NFTee address: 0x0bef7A08F0E5eAFF11C863a3db8568E7a0b571a5
